# Running Custom Playwright Code

Use `run-code` to execute arbitrary Playwright code for advanced scenarios not covered by CLI commands.

## Syntax

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  // Your Playwright code here
  // Access page.context() for browser context operations
}"
```

## Geolocation

```bash
# Grant geolocation permission and set location
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });
}"

# Set location to London
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278 });
}"

# Clear geolocation override
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().clearPermissions();
}"
```

## Permissions

```bash
# Grant multiple permissions
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions([
    'geolocation',
    'notifications',
    'camera',
    'microphone'
  ]);
}"

# Grant permissions for specific origin
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['clipboard-read'], {
    origin: 'https://example.com'
  });
}"
```

## Media Emulation

```bash
# Emulate dark color scheme
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' });
}"

# Emulate light color scheme
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'light' });
}"

# Emulate reduced motion
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' });
}"

# Emulate print media
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ media: 'print' });
}"
```

## Wait Strategies

```bash
# Wait for network idle
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
}"

# Wait for specific element
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForSelector('.loading', { state: 'hidden' });
}"

# Wait for function to return true
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForFunction(() => window.appReady === true);
}"

# Wait with timeout
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForSelector('.result', { timeout: 10000 });
